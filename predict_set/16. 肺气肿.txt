How old are you ?
I'm 65 yeares old.
What's troubling you?
I have had a bed cough and my heart is beating very fast. My blood pressure is highter.
Have you taken some mediceine the doctor gave you? Have you given up smoking and kept off any alcohol?
No, I have not by now.
Now you have suffered emphysema and your blood pressure and heart are abnomal. So from now on, you must stop smoking and keep off any alcohol till forever.
