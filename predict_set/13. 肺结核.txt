I have had a cough for about two years. I paid no attention to it because I thought it was from smoking. Two weeks ago I caught a cold. Since then I have felt very weak and feverish. My temperature is always a little higher in the afternoon.
When you cough do you bring up any phlegm?
Just a small amount, usually whitish. Occasionally I noticed some blood. This worried me .so I came to consult you.
Blood in the sputum strongly indicates tuberculosis. We must take a chest X-ray.
The X-ray suggests the likelihood of tuberculosis.
Is it serious? Can I be cured?
Don't worry. Nowadays, even those advanced cases with proper treatment can be cured within six months. Drug treatment should be continued for two years, however.
Please send a fresh specimen of your sputum for testing. I'll prescribe rimifon 0.1g three times a day and injections of streptomycin 1gm once a day. By the way, you need also a good rest and good food.
When should I return?
In about two months.
