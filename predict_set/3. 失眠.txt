Good morning, doctor.
good morning. What seems to be the trouble?
I'm suffering from insomnia.
How long have you had this problem?
Three months.
Have you take any medicine?
I tried some sleeping pills, but they have done nothing for me.
Do you have headaches?
Sometimes. I have no appetite and always on the edge.
Let me take your blood pressure. You look anemic. (Taking the patient's blood pressure.)
Well, there is nothing to be alarmed about. You are just a little exhausted from overwork.
What should I do then?
I think you need more rest. Try to get outdoors more. Don't strain yourself too much.
Thank you. Doctor. I'll do as you say.
Here is the prescription for you. I'm sure the medicine will cure your insomnia.
Thanks a lot. Bye-bye!
Bye!
