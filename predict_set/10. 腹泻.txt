When did your diarrhea start?
It started last night.
Do you remember how many times you went to the toiles?
I can't remember exactly. It must have been over 10 times.
What kind of stool did you notice, watery or mucous?
At first it was watery, but there is mucus now.
Do you feel abdominal pain when you go to the toilet?
Yes.
Have you vomited?
No, but I feel nauseated.
I'll take a sample of your stool for examination. Your condition doesn't seem serious, but we must give you intravenous infusion to prevent dehydration and antibiotics as well.
Thank you.
