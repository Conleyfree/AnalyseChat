I have an awful toothache.
Tell me which one .
The last one in the lower jaw hurts when coming in contact with hot or cold things . The pain has got worse in the last three days . I don't know which tooth is causing the trouble.
Does the pain get worse at night?
Yes, it hurts so much at night that I can't sleep .
please open your mouth and let me examine your teeth Oh, the last molar has a cavity . It is very big . It has caused plupitis, so it hurts badly.
How to cure it?
First . I'll give you an injection of anaesthetic, then I'll drill it and put some pain-killing drug in the hole, the pain will soon stop.
Doctor, it's all right now .
I'll give you some pain-killing, drugs if necessary, take one tablet for the pain . Please come back in two days . I'll examine it again . Good bye.
Thank you, Doctor . Good bye.
