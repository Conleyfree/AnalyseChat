Is it effective?Just as effective as acupuncture which we are using to treat you. But cupping therapy is specially good for pains.To tell the truth, according to statistics, Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is better for the treatment of diseases of viral infections, immune system, cardio-cerebrovascular system and nervous system without causing any side-effects compared with western medicine.
That's really fantastic.Thank you very much! Doctor. I've got a better understanding of TCM now.
