Good morning. This is Doctor Johnson's office. What can I do for you?
Yes, this is Mrs. Reed. I'd like to make an appointment to see the doctor this week.
Well, let's see. I'm afraid he is fully booked on Monday and Tuesday.
Mrs. Reed: How about Thursday?
Clerk: Sorry, but I have to say he is also occupied on Thursday. So, will Wednesday be O.K. for you, Mrs. Reed?
Mrs. Reed: I have to work on Wednesday. By the way, is Dr. Johnson available on Saturday?
Clerk: I'm afraid the office is closed on weekends.
Mrs. Reed: well, what about Friday?
Clerk: Friday. Let me have a check. Oh, great. Dr. Johnson will be available on Friday afternoon this week.
Mrs. Reed: That's fine. Thank you, I'll come then.
