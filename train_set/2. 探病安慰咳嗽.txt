Ann, thank you for coming to see me.Don't say that, we are good friends....ke,ke,...,I got a bad cough. It seems to be dead.Don't say this, you will be better off.
Hope so. Could you please hand the medicines over to me? It is time to take the medicines.No problem.
I have been already afraid to take medicines every day.How many tablets should you take each day?20 tablets for each day, they taste very bitter.
Good medicine for health tastes bitter to the mouth.
