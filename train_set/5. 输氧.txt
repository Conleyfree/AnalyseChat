Let me put another pillow under your head. You have to breathe some oxygen.
What shall I do then?
No, I'll put nasal cannulae into your nostrils and tape the tubes onto your cheek.
Well, my nostrils are very sensitive.
Don't worry. I'll try the mask. And I don't think you need a tent. do I?
Of course,or I'll be hopeless.
