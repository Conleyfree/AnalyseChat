What's the matter with you ?I have a toothache. It is painful.
how often do you brush your teeth? Once a day.
Do you like eat chocolates or candies? Yes,I do!I like them very much!
Please remember,don't eat too many sweet things..They are not good for your teeth. And you should brush your teeth twice a day or three times a day..If you take my advice,you will be better than now.Thank you ,doctor.I'll take your advice.
