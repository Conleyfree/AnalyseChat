Hello, Mr. Smith. How are you felling today?Much better, thank you! I can sit straight today.
The acupuncture is really great.Yes, Chinese Traditional Medicine (TCM) has a history of more than 5,000 years. It has a complete theory about the occurrence, development and treatment of diseases.
Acupuncture is only one of the most effective ways to treat diseases such as your pleurapophysis.
All the same, many of my colleagues feel much puzzled about TCM. Would you please tell me more about it? Sure.
According to TCM theory, the occurrence of diseases is the incoordination between Yin and Yang and the treatment of diseases is the reestablishement of the equilibrium between them.
