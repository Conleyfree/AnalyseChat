Please come in. What seems to be the trouble?It's my stomach. I think probably I had too much at supper yesterday evening.
Can you tell me what you had for supper yesterday evening?Seafood, roastduck. Oh, a great variety of things, I can't name them exactly.
Have you vomitted?Yes, I have vomitted three times and made several trips to the bathroom last night.
I see. Now you have to get your stools tested. I'll write out a slip and you can take it to the laboratory. Wait for a while and pick up the report, and then bring it back to me.
Take your seat, and let me have a look. It's nothing serious, only indigestion due to too much oily food. I will prescribe you some medicine for it to make you feel better. I do advise you to avoid oily food for the next few days.I will follow your advice. Thanks a lot.You are welcome.
