Nurse, would you like to tell me something about caries?Of course . What do you want to know?
What causes dental caries?It's mainly caused by certain organisms of the oral flora.It is an irreversible, slowly progressive decay of the hard tissues . It leads to a disintegration of tooth structures and cavitation.
I wonder if the lesions occus predominantly in particular regions of the tooth(teeth)?That's right . It's also connected with the defect of the structure of the tooth(teeth)?
What is the defect of the structure of the tooth(teeth)?It means the dyspasia of the dentine or the uneven squeezingly positioned teeth and the physically defect with sulci and fossae on the teeth.
How can we prevent this disease?The first . it's very important that you pay more attention to the dental hygiene . You should brush your teeth twice a day . once in the morning, and once in the evening . The upper row of the teeth should be brushed first, then the lower row . All the crevices must be cleared of remnant food . Besides that . you should rinse your mouth after meals . The second, take less sweet food, especially for children . Don't take fermented food before you go to bed or wake up at night, such as candy or biscuit . The third, come here for periodical checkups once or twice a year . Caries may progress microscopically a considerable period of time before the lesion can be observed clinically in the tooth strucure . Generally if the cavity is not deep, you'll have no symptom, so you should have the permanent filling in case that the cavity may get bigger . The fourth, the methods in using immunization, laser and coating material to prevent caries are still being carried out in tests . The fifth, to build up your health is very important.
